# 🕹️ [Play The Game In Your Browser!](https://ddh.github.io/goats-of-the-hill/)

## 🐐 Say What?
Originally a culminating project for a CS course, that has evolved into something more...
* Local multiplayer with Xbox 360 controller support
* Play against AIs who play "fair"
* Super duper accurate physics
* Three incredibly realistic stages
* End-game leaderboard
* AMAZING powerups
* And more!

## 🐏 Reviews
> It's like Smash Bros, but with goats. So it's better really.

> Why is the AI so spazzy?

> It's such a baaaaaaaaaa-d game. I'm just _kidding_.

> Plenty of salt to go around for these goats.
